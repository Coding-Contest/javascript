# Instructions



## 1. Find the sum of two arrays

Given two arrays made up of digits, write a function that interprets the arrays as numbers and sums them:

```javascript
// 123 becomes [1, 2, 3]
//   7 becomes [0, 0, 7]
twoSum([1, 2, 3], [0, 0, 7]);
//=> 130
```

## 2. Determine if the number is lucky

In this exercise a number is said to be lucky if it is a palindrome.

Implement a function to determine whether the number is lucky.

```javascript
luckyNumber(1441);
//=>  true

luckyNumber(123);
//=> false
```

## 3. Dashify a number

Implement a function that takes a number and places a dash between each digit

```javascript
dashify(1466);
//=> "1-4-6-6"
```
