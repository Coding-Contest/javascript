# Instructions

As an online fruit seller, you will have to manage your stock inventory according to your customers so you can give them fresh fruits as quickly as possible. To keep things simple, you created the grocer's API, and now, you need to write a small functions library that will interact with your API and give you quick good results.

You are creating a e-commerec

## 1. Create a callback to be called when the order is successful

Write a callback function name `onSuccess` which should invoke the import `notify` function.You have to return a `SUCCESS` message when the order is successful.

```javascript
onSuccess();
// => `notify` called with `{ message: 'SUCCESS' }`
```

## 2. Create a callback to be called when the order fails with an error

Write a callback function name `onError` which should invoke the import `notify` function.You have to return an `ERROR` message when the order encounters an error.

```javascript
onError();
// => `notify` called with `{ message: 'ERROR' }`
```

## 3. Create a wrapper to wrap the external api function

The grocer's API provides a function to order from their inventory called `order`. It receives three arguments: a _query_, a _callback_ function to be invoked when the order is successful, and a _callback_ function to be invoked when the order encounters an error. You decide to wrap the api function call in a newly defined function `orderFromGrocer` to insulate your codebase from external changes. Your function should forward the arguments (which match the provided api function) to the api function.

The query takes the form of an _object_:

```typescript
const query = {
  variety: string,
  quantity: number,
};
```

```javascript
orderFromGrocer(
  { variety: 'pear', quantity: 12 },
  exampleSuccessCallback,
  exampleErrorCallback,
);
// => `order` was called with the query and the callbacks
```

## 4. Create a convenient short function

You find that you are calling this function from many different places with the same functions. Seeing an opportunity to refactor your code, you want to create a function where you can supply the variety and quantity to order as arguments.

```javascript
postOrder('peach', 100);
// => order submitted for 100 peaches
```
