# Hints

## 1. Create a set of useful strings

- [const][mdn-const] are blocked scoped that have a value that can't be changed through reassignment.

## 2. Create a set of useful characters

- same as #1

## 3. Combine phrases to build up messages

- [template strings][mdn-template-strings] - Template literals - allow for substitution of strings and embedded expressions
- [ternary operator][mdn-ternary-operator] is a short-hand way of operating on conditions, similar to `if/elseif/else`. It can be easier to use in template strings because it is condensed.

## 4. Build a graduation sign

- [String interpolation][string-interpolation] is performed by placing the expression whose value you want to place in the string inside a set of parentheses which are preceded by a backslash character.

## 5. Compute the cost of a sign

- A string instance has a property - [`length`][mdn-string-length] - that will get the length of the string.
