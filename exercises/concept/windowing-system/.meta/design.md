# Design

## Learning objectives

- Simple intro to OOP (e.g. "building objects that encapsulate values, called instance properties, and functions that work on these values, these functions are called methods") and why it is useful (structure code, re-use etc.)
- Javascript is a "prototype-based language", what does that mean?
- How to a constructor function to create a "template object" with properties and methods using prototype syntax
- What does `this` mean/do
- What is an instance and how to create one with `new`
- How to write the same code as above with class syntax (explain what that means)

## Out of Scope

The following topics will be introduced later and should therefore not be part of this concept exercise.

- `this` in non-class contexts
- inheritance between classes (`extends`, `super`)

## Concepts

The Concept this exercise unlocks is:

- `classes`

## Prerequisites

- `functions` as they are the basis for classes
- `objects` as they are the basis for instances

## Notes

The exercise is ported from [Windowing System Exercise in the Swift track][swift-windowing-system]. Some tasks where omitted to shorten the exercise.
