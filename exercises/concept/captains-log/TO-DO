                        - note: Testing for randomness proved a bit tricky. I went for a simple solution that runs the functions multiple times and tests to see that the results are random by seeing if different outputs would be made. It's not perfect. I had to adjust the number of times the tests are run, otherwise there can be false positive / false negative results. The current settings should be working, but please do test this a few times to verify it.
