## Implementation

Implement the `get` and `post` methods from the `RestAPI` class.

- no actual HTTP server should be implemented, just the handler functions should be written
- an in-memory object can serve as "database"
- the constructor function needs to accept a seed for the database as argument (and set up a sensible default if nothing was passed)
