# Implementation

Define a function - `Cost` - that calculates the cost for a given list of books based on defined discounts.

Use the following signature for Cost:

```js
export const cost = (books) => {};
```

Cost will return the total cost (after discounts) in cents.
For example, for a single book, the cost is 800 cents, which equals $8.00.
Only integer calculations are necessary for this exercise.
