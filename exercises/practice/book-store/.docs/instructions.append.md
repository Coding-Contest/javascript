# Implementation

Define a single Js function, Cost, which calculates the cost
for a given list of books based on the defined discounts.

Use the following signature for Cost:

```
export const cost = (books) => {}
```
Cost will return the total cost (after discounts) in cents.
For example, for a single book, the cost is 800 cents, which equals $8.00.
Only integer calculations are necessary for this exercise.
