# About

JavaScript has a built in object: `Date`, which stores date and time, and provides methods for their management.

## Creation

A Date object can be created without arguments to obtain the current date and time:

```javascript
let now = new Date
alert(now) 
//shows current day, date and time in your time zone
```

However, different types of arguments can also be used to create date object, as follows:

### Timestamp value

A timestamp is an integer number representing the number of **milliseconds** that has passed since **Jan 1st of 1970 [UTC][UTC-defn]+0**, however, *with reference to your local time zone.*
This can be used as an argumect for the Date object.

```javascript
// 0 means 01.01.1970 UTC+0
const Jan01_1970 = new Date(0);
console.log( Jan01_1970 );

// adding 24 hours, we get 02.01.1970 UTC+0
const Jan02_1970 = new Date(24 * 3600 * 1000);
console.log( Jan02_1970 );

//Note that the objects created here would show the corresponding time in your time zone
```

~~~~exercism/note
January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC is referred to as the Unix epoch.
Unix is an operating system originally developed in the 1960s.
Early Unix engineers picked that date arbitrarily because they needed to set a uniform date for the start of time, and New Year's Day, 1970, seemed most convenient.

### Timestamp string

A string value representing a date is used, specified in a format recognized by `Date.parse()` method, about which you will learn soon in this article.

### Date object

An existing date object can also be used as an argument.
This makes a copy of the existing `Date` object with the same date and time.
For example:

```javascript
const t1 = new Date();
console.log(time1)

const t2 = new Date(t1)
console.log(t2)
//the results on the console will be the same
```

### Individual date and time component values

Given at least a year and month, this form of `Date()` returns a `Date` object whose component values *(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond)* all come from the following parameters.
Any missing fields are given the lowest possible value (1 for day and 0 for every other component).

The parameter values are all evaluated against the *local time zone, rather than UTC*.

`year`

Integer values from 0 to 99 map to the years 1900 to 1999.
All other values are the actual year.

`monthIndex`

Integer value representing the month, beginning with *0 for January to 11 for December*.
If a value greater than 11 is passed in, then those months will be added to the date.
For example, new Date(1990, 12, 1) will return January 1st, 1991.

`day` (Optional)

Integer value representing the day of the month.
The default is 1.

`hours` (Optional)

Integer value between 0 and 23 representing the hour of the day.
Defaults to 0.

`minutes` (Optional)

Integer value representing the minute segment of a time.
The default is 0 minutes past the hour.

`seconds` (Optional)

Integer value representing the second segment of a time.
The default is 0 seconds past the minute.

`milliseconds` (Optional)

Integer value representing the millisecond segment of a time.
The default is 0 milliseconds past the second.

```javascript
const date1 = new Date(95, 11, 17) // Creates Date for Dec 17 1995
const date2 = new Date(2013, 12, 5, 13, 24, 0) // Creates Date for Jan 5 2014 13:24
```

## `Date.parse()`

`Date.parse()` takes **string as a input and returns a timestamp** (number of milliseconds from 1 Jan 1970 UTC+0), provided the string is in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ, where:

`YYYY-MM-DD` - is the date: year-month-day.

`T` - The character "T" is used as the delimiter.

`HH:mm:ss.sss` - is the time: hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.

`Z` - This *optional* part denotes the time zone.
If `Z` is present, the `Date` will be set to UTC.
If `Z` is not present, it will be Local Time.

If the format is invalid, `NaN` is returned

Shorter variants are also possible, like `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM` or even `YYYY`. However not that these variants **set the `Date` to UTC**, even though `Z` not mentioned. To understand what exactly happens check out [this section][mdn-diff-assumed-timeZone] of a MDN page.

TODO complete eg below

```javascript
const d1 = Date.parse("2019-01-01")
const d2 = Date.parse("2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z")
console.log(d1, d2)
//Both the above return 1546300800000, as times are set to UTC

const d3 = Date.parse("2019-01-01T00:00:00.000") //This would return a different value (unless you live in GMT) as is set to your local time zone
consol.log(d3)
```

~~~~exercism/caution
The use of `Date.parse()` (and the timestamp string method which works similarly) is strongly discouraged due to browser differences and inconsistencies.

## Accesing `Date` components

The following are the methods to access the year, month and so on from the Date object:

- `getFullYear()`- Get the year (4 digits)

~~~~exercism/caution
Many JavaScript engines implement a non-standard method `getYear()`.
**This method is deprecated.**
It returns 2-digit year sometimes.
Hence, `getFullYear()` must always be used instead
 ~~~~

- `getMonth()`- Get the month, from 0 to 11.

- `getDate()`- Get the day of month, from 1 to 31.

- `getHours()`, `getMinutes()`, `getSeconds()`, `getMilliseconds()`- Get the corresponding time components.

- `getDay()`- Get the day of week, from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday).

- `getTime()`- Get the number of milliseconds passed since 01.01.1970 UTC.

```javascript
const date0 = new Date(0) //Jan 1 1970 00:00:00
console.log(date0.getMonth()) // logs 0, as Jan is the month
console.log(date0.getDay())// find out which day the new year was!

const date1 = new Date(2020, 11, 13, 5) // Dec 13 2020 5:00:00
console.log(date1.getTime()) //find out how many have milliseconds passed since Jan 1 1890! 
```

## Modifying `Date` components

The following methods allow to modify date/time components :

- `setFullYear(year, [month], [date])`

- `setMonth(month, [date])`

- `setDate(date)`

- `setHours(hour, [min], [sec], [ms])`

- `setMinutes(min, [sec], [ms])`

- `setSeconds(sec, [ms])`

- `setMilliseconds(ms)`

- `setTime(timestamp)` (sets the whole date by milliseconds since 01.01.1970 UTC)

Paremeters in `[]` above are *optional*. If not mentioned, the components are not modified

Every one of them except `setTime()` has a UTC-variant, for instance: `setUTCHours()`.

```javascript
let today = new Date();

today.setHours(0);
console.log(today); // still today, but only the hour is changed to 0

today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
console.log(today); // still today, now sharply 00:00:00
```

## Calculating Time Difference and `Date.now()`

To measure the time elapsed between two given dates, we can use the `Date.getTime()` method.

```javascript
const d1 = new Date(2021, 12, 11, 5, 13, 32, 21)
const d2 = new Date(2021, 12, 23, 4, 12, 55)

alert(d2.getTime()-d1.getTime()) //1033162979 milliseconds elapsed
```

Moreover, if we wish to measure the time taken on a live basis, for example the time taken for execution for program, we could use `Date.now()` which provides the tiimestamp of current time.

As you might notice, this is semantically equivalent to `new Date().getTime()`, but it doesnâ€™t create an intermediate `Date` object.
Hence, it makes the code more efficient.

```javascript
const start = Date.now(); // milliseconds count from 1 Jan 1970

// execute a task
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  let task = i * i * i * i;
}

const end = Date.now(); // done

alert(end - start); //time taken by the loop in 1 second
```

## Comparing Dates

We can use `<` and `>` operators to compare two `Date` objects, the date occuring *later being treated as greater*.

The `==` or `===` do not work with `Date`, and output `false` in any case, even if dates are equal.
However, we could use the `Date.getTime()` method to obtain the timestamps(which is of the data type: number) and compare them using equality operators.

```javascript
const d1 = new Date(2021, 12, 11)
const d2 = new Date(1990, 11, 23)

console.log(d1 > d2) //true

const d1Copy = new Date (d1) //d1Copy will be same as d1

console.log(d1Copy === d1) //logs false, even though they are same
console.log(d1Copy.getTime() === d1.getTime()) //true
```
