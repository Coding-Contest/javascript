# About

FIXME

- function declaration (default)

- function expression, difference, when to use them (if assignment is needed, one off cases)

- link to arrow functions

- how to invoke

- passing around

## Parameters

- all args are optional
- too few
- too many
- default params

## Pass by value vs. pass by reference

## Return

- only return 1 value
- many returns allowed
- what if naked return or no return
- how to return multiple things?

## Scope

- what is declared inside only visible inside
- what is outside is also visible
- inner takes precendence over the outer one but shadowing should be avoided

Pitfall new line after return?
Advice on naming?
one function, one action?
avoid massive functions
very short function names like \_
