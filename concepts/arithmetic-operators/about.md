# About 
Javascript uses 6 different kinds of operators to perform arithmetic operation on numbers.
- `+`: The addition operator is used to find sum of numbers. 
  ```javascipt
  1 + 2; // => 3
  2.5 + 3.9; // => 6.5
  ```

- `-`: The subtraction operator is used to find the differece between two numbers 
  ```javascipt
  19 - 2; // => 17
  7.4 - 1.2; // => 1.5
  ```

- `*`: The multiplication operator is used to find the product of two numbers two numbers 
  ```javascipt
  7 * 5; // => 35
  9.2 * 6.3; // => 57.959999999999994
  ```

- `/`: The division operator is used to divide two numbers.
  ```javascipt
  8 / 2; // => 4
  25 / 3; // => 8.333333333333334
  ```

- `%`: The remainder operator is used to find the remainder of a division performed.
  ```javascipt
  40 % 4; // => 0
  11 % 4; // => 3
  ```

- `**`: The exponentiation operator is used to raise a number to a power.
  ```javascipt
  4 ** 3; // => 62
  4 ** 1/2; // => 2
  ```
  
 Moreover, numbers storead as variables can also be used for all arithmetic operations.
 ```javascript
 let p = 4;
 let q = 2;
 
 let sum_ab = p + q; // => 6
 let pow_ab = p ** q; // => 16
 ```

## Using Additon Operator with Strings
The `+` operator can also be used to concatenate strings
```javascript
 let a = 'Ex';
 let b = 'er';
 let c = 'cism';
 
 console.log(a + b + c);
 // =>  Exercism
 ```
