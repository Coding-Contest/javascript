# Introduction

With a while loop you can execute code repeatably as long as a certain condition is true.
It is written with the `while` keyword followed by a condition wrapped in round brackets and a code block that contains the _body_ of the loop wrapped in curly brackets.

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code that is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true
}
```

If you want to evaluate the condition after the body was executed, you can use the do-while loop instead.

```javascript
do {
  // the code here will always be executed once and then repeatedly
  // if the condition is true after the last iteration
} while (condition);
```
