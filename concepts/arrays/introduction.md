# Introduction

In Javascript, an array is a list-like structure with no fixed length which can hold any type of primitives or objects, even mixed types.
The array elements can be accessed by their index.

Example of an array declaration and accessing an element by index:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers[2];
// => 3
```
