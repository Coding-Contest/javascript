# Introduction

In Javascript, an array is a list-like structure with no fixed length which can hold any type of primitives or objects, even mixed types.

To create an array, add elements between square brackets `[]`. To read from the array, put the index in square brackets `[]` after the identifier. The indices of an array start at zero.

For example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 'two', 3, 'four'];
numbers[2];
// => 3
```
